CHALLENGE # 9 

Module 9 Challenge - Employee SQL

# Introduction

This challenge looked at SQL and how to filter the data and create an ERD Diagram
By creating primary and foreign keys, we are able to determine One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationships


# Description

6 Tables were created using QuickDBD. From there the relationships were established (Primary, Foreign Keys also created).
After this we uploaded the data to a schema in Visual Studio Code, and from there, the data was uploaded to pgAdmin (postgres SQL).
From here the queries were done to determine the final tables.  

* Key note, the tables were created in order (order is important in identifying the relationships). 



# Installation

Quick DBD, Visual Studio Code, pgAdmin
